# Review from Reviewer 

## Reviewer Note 
> Great work really
>
> well-formatted code along with a smoothly working app with so nice UI and transition animations, you did a great job here really. MVVM implemented correctly along with efficiently using data-binding, also navigation works great. This is one of the best projects I've reviewed.

## Code Quality 
- Correctly use ViewModel and LiveData lifecycle classes in an Android app
> Well-done implementing activity-scoped shared ViewModel between fragments,these fragments can share a ViewModel using their activity scope to handle this communication,Shoe list fragment updates correctly upon adding new shoe item in details fragment. 👌 further resources:

- Correctly implement Single Activity architecture
> Really good, Single-activity multiple fragments approach implemented very well, few resources to discuss this approach vs multiple activities:

- Write error-free code
> app builds and runs without errors, 👏

## Layouts 
- Create layouts using the correct ViewGroups and Views in an Android app.
> Great,ConstraintLayout allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups). It's similar to RelativeLayout in that all views are laid out according to relationships between sibling views and the parent layout, but it's more flexible than RelativeLayout and easier to use with Android Studio's Layout Editor. here are a couple of resources to master ConstrainLayout:
